                                <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    
        <p> Hi, I am Vincent Nino, I attend James Campbell High School. I hope to get a decent grade on this project, I am not great at doing code but I certainly try to do my best at it. More about me, I like Red pandas because they are cute. Pandas, foxes, and racoons are my weakness, I also find making memes enojayble.</p>

                    <h1>Personal Interests and More</h1>
    </div>
    
<p>I have very few interests but the few things I like to do are play video games, star gaze, and sleeping under a tree when its hot outside. Not sure if sleeping under a tree is a personal interest but if I think it is then it is! I am an animal lover so I have a very large soft spot for any kind of animal. I like fluffy things because well, lets be honest, who doesnt? I dont really know what else to say, I'm not really that much of an interesting person.</p>
